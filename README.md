# ParkingLot

Refined version of parking lot challenge

Uses an array of class `ParkingSpace` to organize and modify data

Test Suite includes some tests to show functionality

This code also handles the interesting case where 3 open medium spots does not necessarily mean a van can park. They must be 3 contiguous medium spaces for the van to park.
